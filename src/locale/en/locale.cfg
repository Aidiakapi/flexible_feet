flexible_feet_ignored_tile_types=List of semi-colon separated names of tile types which should not be processed. Example: tar;toxic
flexible_feet_expression=A math expression used to calculate a new value for movement speed multiplier. It takes a single parameter x, which will be in the range specified below. 1 means 100% movement speed, 0 means 0% movement speed. See the mod portal page for more information.
flexible_feet_round=When checked, movement speed will be rounded to 10%s.
flexible_feet_range_lower=The lower end of the range of values to which the expression is applied. Values outside the range are left unchanged. Default 0.
flexible_feet_range_upper=The upper end of the range of values to which the expression is applied. Values outside the range are left unchanged. Set this equal to the the lower range to disable the range altogether, and evaluate the expression for every input. Default 1.
